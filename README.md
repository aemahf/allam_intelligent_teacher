# The Intelligent Teacher Application

This is an educational application developed in **Construct 3**. The project files and assets are stored within the `Construct 3` folder, and the application can be executed locally by running a local server using the `server.mjs` file. The server facilitates communication with APIs, including **ALLAM API**.

## Project Structure

- **Construct 3 Folder**: Contains all the project files required to build and run the educational application.
- **server.mjs**: This file is responsible for initializing the local server and managing the main API calls, including those related to the **ALLAM** prompts.
- **IBM Files**: A folder containing a zip file with prompts extracted from IBM resources.
- **recorder.js**: Integrated into the Construct 3 project to handle **voice interaction** functionalities, allowing users to interact with the alphabet letters via their voice.
- **Credential Files**:
  - `elevenlabscredentials.json`
  - `googlecredentials.json`
  - `ibmcredentials.json`

  > **Note**: These files are used for API calls but have been cleared of sensitive data.
